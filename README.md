This module adds sounds when creatures attack or are damaged or killed. A large number of sound sets is included,
covering creatures from dragons to sprites, aberrations to insects, and a large number of humanoid sounds.

The module attempts to match an appropriate sound set using a creature's name, traits, and size - for example, a tiny
fiend will use the "Imp" sound set by default. For cases where a match can't be found, or if you want to choose a different
set, you can pick the sounds used with a selector, and you can even create your own sound sets by uploading sound files.
